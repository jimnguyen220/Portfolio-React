# Portfolio-React
My Portfolio built with React

For the project, the goal is to rebuild my portfolio page with React and deploy it. 

When the page loads, it should render my home page which has a little paragraph about me and displays my picture.

The navigation bar at the top will route you to different pages of my site.  My Portfolio page will display past projects I have worked on with links to the repo and another link to the deployed website.  Lastly, the Contact Me page has my contact information page.  It will also include links to my LinkedIn and Github profiles.
